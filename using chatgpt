You are using RStudio to conduct R programming tasks in POSIT remote server with preloaded tidyverse package. If the task is programming related, the programming style should follow tidyverse style as closely as possible, i.e. if certain task can be done in both base R and tidyverse, use tidyverse. The package tidyverse is already loaded. Any provided code that uses its functions will work -- no need to library it again. tidyverse is a collection of packages designed for data science. It includes ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, readr, purrr, tibble, stringr, forcats, and haven. When there is possibility to use chain operator, always use |> instead of %>%.

If the code uses filter() from dplyr package, ALWAYS write dplyr::filter() instead of just filter(). For functions from dplyr package that use .groups = 'drop' option, instead of using it,  remove it and use ungroup(). When use tidyr::pivot_longer() function, names_to and values_to argument values should be a string.

When codes are involved with labels or names that are not conventional (i.e using only a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and _), the labels or names should be enclosed in backticks.

If the task mentions an object but does not give the content of the object, assume that the object is already in the global environment, and don't create an example of that object in the code.

If I ask you to rename a data frame's variables but provide no current variable names, ask me what are they. Then rename them to concise names in snake case.

If I ask you to parse a variable into a factor or ordered factor without mentioning its levels, ask me "what are the levels of the factor? or ignore this question", and also give me the command of using unique() to find the levels. If I provide the levels, then parse the variable into a factor with the specified levels.

When parse date or date time, always use lubridate package's parsing function rather than using as.Date. To parse monthly data, use ym function. To parse quarterly data, use yq function. If the date is Taiwan date, be aware the year is not a western year unless you take out yyyy part and add 1911 to it. If time zone of a date time string is given, use tz argument in date parsing function to set the time zone -- not using with_tz. For time, use hms to parse. But if the value before parsing is not in "hh:mm:ss" format, change it to that format before parsing.

String. Always use stringr package to deal with string. For pattern regarding "may or may not be there", if it is about one character, say "X may or may not be there", use "X?"; if it is about a phrase "XXX may or may not be there" use "(XXX)?". When applying a function from stringr package to a variable, if the variable is not a character type, convert it to character type first.

Throughout the conversation, if certain packages are imported through library() function, such packages should not be imported again in the following code answers.

When my task requires more details to be clear, ask me for more details. If the task is too broad, help me narrow it down by listing directions that I can pursue.

Got it! I'll adhere to the guidelines you mentioned. If you have any specific tasks or need assistance with R code, feel free to share the details, and I'll follow the style and approach accordingly!

how to import a data into RAM

To import data into R's RAM (memory), you can use various functions depending on the data format. Since the tidyverse is preloaded, I will focus on functions from readr and readxl, which are part of the tidyverse.

Here are some common ways to import data:

1. Importing CSV or TSV files
If you are importing data from a CSV or TSV file, you can use readr::read_csv() for CSV files or readr::read_tsv() for TSV files.

r
複製程式碼
data <- readr::read_csv("path/to/your/file.csv")
or for TSV:

r
複製程式碼
data <- readr::read_tsv("path/to/your/file.tsv")
2. Importing Excel files
If your data is in an Excel file (either .xls or .xlsx), you can use readxl::read_excel().

r
複製程式碼
data <- readxl::read_excel("path/to/your/file.xlsx")
3. Importing from other sources
RDS format: If your data is in an RDS file, you can use readRDS():

r
複製程式碼
data <- readRDS("path/to/your/file.rds")
Text file: For general text files, you can use readr::read_delim():

r
複製程式碼
data <- readr::read_delim("path/to/your/file.txt", delim = "\t")  # Adjust delimiter if needed
After loading your data, it will be stored in memory in the data object, which can be manipulated as needed. Let me know if you need more specific advice for your case!

how to parse a data

Parsing data typically means converting a variable into a specific data type, such as converting a character variable to a factor, date, or numeric type. I'll cover a few common scenarios based on the guidelines you've provided.

1. Parsing a Date or Date-Time
To parse dates or date-times, use lubridate's functions such as ym(), yq(), mdy(), dmy(), ymd(), etc., based on the format of your data.

For Date (Year-Month) format:
r
複製程式碼
data$parsed_date <- lubridate::ym(data$your_date_column)
For Date (Year-Quarter) format:
r
複製程式碼
data$parsed_date <- lubridate::yq(data$your_date_column)
For standard Date format (e.g., "YYYY-MM-DD"):
r
複製程式碼
data$parsed_date <- lubridate::ymd(data$your_date_column)
For Date-time with Time Zone: If your date-time data includes a time zone, use the tz argument:
r
複製程式碼
data$parsed_datetime <- lubridate::ymd_hms(data$your_datetime_column, tz = "Asia/Taipei")
For Taiwan Date: If the year is in Taiwan's calendar, you will need to adjust the year:
r
複製程式碼
data$parsed_date <- lubridate::ymd(paste0(as.numeric(substr(data$your_date_column, 1, 4)) + 1911, substr(data$your_date_column, 5, 10)))
2. Parsing a Factor
If you want to parse a variable into a factor, you can use factor() and specify the levels if needed.

Parsing into a factor:
r
複製程式碼
data$your_factor_column <- factor(data$your_column, levels = c("level1", "level2", "level3"))
If you do not have the levels predefined, you can find them first with unique():

r
複製程式碼
unique(data$your_column)
Once you know the levels, you can create the factor as shown above.

3. Parsing a Factor into an Ordered Factor
If you want the factor to have an order, you can use factor() and specify the ordered = TRUE argument, along with defining the levels in the desired order.

Parsing into an ordered factor:
r
複製程式碼
data$your_ordered_factor_column <- factor(data$your_column, levels = c("low", "medium", "high"), ordered = TRUE)
4. Parsing Numeric Variables
To parse a character column into a numeric type, you can use as.numeric():

r
複製程式碼
data$your_numeric_column <- as.numeric(data$your_column)
5. Parsing Time (hms format)
For parsing time data (e.g., "HH:MM:SS"), use hms::hms():

r
複製程式碼
data$your_time_column <- hms::hms(data$your_column)
Feel free to share more details about the specific data you're working with, and I can help with more tailored parsing examples!
